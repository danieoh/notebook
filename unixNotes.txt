--Some Commands--
# mkdir : make a directory
# touch : make a file
# mv : move and/or rename a file
# cp : copy and/or rename the copy
# rm : remove a file or directory -rf (recursive forced)
# clear | history : either clear or print all commands
# cat | less | head | tail : echos the file contents to terminal. Less will give you a paged view with additional 
functionality. the Head and Tail will give you the first or last 10 lines of a file.
# sort : outputs a file in a sorted order. 
# grep : find something (in a file or in a directory, etc).

--Flags and Misc--
- for the cp and rm commands the "-r" flag enables doing things on directories.
- you can make directories that don't exist with -p as in mkdir -p (or path).
- history command with the an int shows last N (like history 10 shows last 10 commands).
- note the history line number can be called again like !645 runs the 645th command from history.
- you can re-run the last command by doing "!!"
- CTRL+R can give you a search for the history of your commands.

--Redirection--
- you can output command outputs to a file with ">" like "history > log.txt"
- ">" does overwrite and ">>" does append, so history >> log.txt if done once already would double+1 the lines.
- note that using this output ">" is called "command redirection," because instead of piping to terminal we 
"redirect" to a file.

--Chaining Commands--
- you can use "|" to chain full commands together. like "head -n 4 notes.txt | sort > sortedNotes.txt" 
  will execute the head's output to execute the sort that redirects to a file.
- alternatively you can chain two executions (instead of piping to another command) with something like
  "head -n 4 | tail -n 1"
- with something like <history | grep "cp -r"> will find, from history's output anything that contains the
  string "cp -r"

--Anatomy of a Unix command--

  cr.
