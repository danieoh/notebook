==Code Reviews==
- commit a small amount (a page or less) for a code review for more agile CRs.
- When you do a CR, your name is on the code as well (you are accountable).
- what should you look for when you are asking for a code review:
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Whether Testing has been done?
  - Is unit testing done?
  - What has the customer not asked for which they might?
  - 
- make CRs concise and focused in order to make sure they are not blockers.

==Branching and Trunks==
- If you are going to do branching, you should generally do all of your interstitial commits
  and commit --ammends in your branch BEFORE you PUSH to mainline. It should be stable and
  if applicable, stand-alone before you merge into the main trunk where people will also
  be pulling it down to do their own work (or even be syncing to it).
