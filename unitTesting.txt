- Gray Box Testing:
-

- One practice for a constructor: do not make it do to much, like, do you need to do a service call just to
  instantiate an object.

- Testing will show you when something is modular or not. For example, like when you are trying to test a toilet:
  it should not be so heavily integrated into a house (or designed as such) that you can't test it in your garage.

- Class Partitioning: Values like 0.00 to 100.00 to 1000.00, etc.

- Boundar Value: Values like 1.00 to 99.00 within a class.

- Integration Testing: When you remove the mocks and run the exact same tests integrating the pieces together
  integrated.
